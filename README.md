# Sri Lanka Paddy Harvest Prediction

This project aims to develop a regression model to predict historical paddy harvests in Sri Lanka based on district-level data, climate conditions, and agricultural practices. It also explores district-level variations, climate-driven analysis, and implications for sustainable rice production and food security.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

- Districts: Districts in Sri Lanka
- Year: Year of observation
- Season: Season of paddy cultivation (Yala or Maha)
- Avg_Temperature: Average temperature during the season
- Avg_rainfall: Average rainfall during the season
- Land_Area: Land area dedicated to paddy cultivation
- Fertilizer: Amount of fertilizer used
- Yeild: Paddy harvest yield
