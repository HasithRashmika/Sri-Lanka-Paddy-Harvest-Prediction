# Project Description

This project aims to develop a regression model to predict historical paddy harvests in Sri Lanka based on district-level data, climate conditions, and agricultural practices. It explores district-level variations, climate-driven analysis, and implications for sustainable rice production and food security.

## Objectives

- Develop a regression model for predicting historical paddy harvests.
- Explore district-level variations in paddy harvests.
- Assess the impact of climate conditions and agricultural practices on harvest yields.
- Predict future paddy harvests based on projected changes in climate conditions and agricultural practices.

# Data Description
data_description = """
# Data Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Districts**: Districts in Sri Lanka
- **Year**: Year of observation
- **Season**: Season of paddy cultivation (Yala or Maha)
- **Avg_Temperature**: Average temperature during the season
- **Avg_rainfall**: Average rainfall during the season
- **Land_Area**: Land area dedicated to paddy cultivation
- **Fertilizer**: Amount of fertilizer used
- **Yeild**: Paddy harvest yield

## Preprocessing

- Cleaned missing values and outliers.
- Encoded categorical variables.
- Scaled numerical features.

# Data Preprocessing

The dataset underwent the following preprocessing steps:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values were imputed or dropped based on the context.
2. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
3. **Scaling Numerical Features**: Numerical features were scaled to a standard range using Min-Max scaling or Standard scaling.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Insights from exploratory data analysis (EDA):

- Visualized distributions, relationships, and patterns in the data.
- Examined correlations between variables.
- Identified outliers and anomalies.

# Regression Modeling

The regression modeling approach included:

- Selection of regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression).
- Feature engineering techniques (e.g., polynomial features, feature scaling).
- Model evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, R-squared).
- Hyperparameter tuning using techniques like cross-validation.

Key results from the regression modeling:

- Performance metrics of the predictive model.
- Interpretation of regression coefficients and feature importance.
- Discussion of significant predictors and their impact on harvest yields.
